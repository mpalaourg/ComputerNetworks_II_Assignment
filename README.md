# Computer Networks II Assignment, AUTh [2019]
> Simple usage of UDP Protocol to communicate with "Ithaki" Server.

<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "Computer Networks II" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2019.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The goal of the Assignment was to establish connection with "Ithaki" Server, send requests for datagrams/packages and receive them. Those packages, were:
<ul>
<li> Echo packages, with a specific format. </li>
<li> Image packages, received and save as .jpeg files. </li>
<li> Audio packages, received, decoded and save as .wav files. </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Differential Pulse Code Modulation (<b>DPCM</b>) encoding. </li>
  <li> Adaptive Quantiser - Differential Pulse Code Modulation (<b>AQ - DPCM</b>) encoding. </li>
  </ul>
<li> Communicate with IthakiCopter, to receive telemetry info (TCP Connection used). </li>
<li> OnBoard Diagnoctics from a vehicle. </li>
</ul>
